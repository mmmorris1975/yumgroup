# This LWRP will provide a means of installing yum packages via yum groups.  At this point
# we're simply going to trust in the idempotentcy of the yum commands.  We may need to make
# this a bit more robust in the future (a la Chef's yum_package provider), but I need a quick
# and dirty now.
#
# First TODOs:
#  - Provide a do_nothing capability to say that no action was taken to make notifications work in a sane way
#  - Fail if specified group does not exist for :install and :upgrade (configurable?)
#  - Do _not_ fail if group is not installed during :remove
